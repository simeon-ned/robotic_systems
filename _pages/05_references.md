### Online materials
* [Control Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m) - YouTube playlist on the concepts of linear and nonlinear control
* [Data Driven Dynamical Systems and Control](http://www.databookuw.com/) - the online text book and collection of short videos on data driven control and engenering 
* [Underactuated Robotis](https://underactuated.mit.edu/) - the perfect course on MIT about numerical methods in control.
* [Slotine control course](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yb411e7t5/) - personally my favourite course on nonlinear control
