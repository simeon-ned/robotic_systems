In this course we will explore **simulation** and **modeling techniques** applicable to robotic systems while linking basic knowledge of mechanics to simulation algorithms:

* Recall what a **model** of robotic system is, why it is needed as well as how to build one.
* Consider different approaches to **integration** of dynamics and check the properties of integrators (Implicit/Explicit Euler, Runge-Kutta)
* We will learn how to apply the **Euler-Lagrange equations** to the systems with constraints holonomic and non-holonomic **constraints** (Lagange Multipliers)
* Consider the **numerical algorithms for constrained dynamics** (Udwadia Qalaba)
* Explore and examine the relatively **novel variation integrators**
* Consider the specific features of simulation through **contact**

By the end of the course you will learn how to build **models** of various **robotic systems**: drones, serial and parallel manipulators, mobile robots, etc. You will also exploit different approaches to **simulation** of these systems.

<!-- 
* **Term project presentation** (final exam): In the end you will apply one of the studied concepts and prepare the short (10-20 min) presentation.

### **Course organization**
* We will have mixed lecture/practice format
* Almost each lecture is based on **research paper** which I will share with you.
* I highly encourage you to do **hand written** notes and not miss classes
* In the end each of you will have **presentation** (term project or paper/concept review) -->

### Prerequisites
