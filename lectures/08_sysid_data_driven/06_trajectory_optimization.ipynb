But I worry that the purely model-free approach is \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater\". We have fantastic tools for making long-term decisions given a model; the model-free approaches are correspondingly much much weaker."

    "So in this chapter I would like to cover the problem of learning a model. This is far from a new problem. The field of \"system identification\" is as old as controls itself, but new results from machine learning have added significantly to our algorithms and our analyses, especially in the high-dimensional and finite-sample regimes. But well before the recent machine learning boom, system identification as a field had a very strong foundation with thorough statistical understanding of the basic algorithms, at least in the asymptotic regime (the limit where the amount of data goes to infinity). Machine learning theory has brought a wealth of new results in the online optimization and finite-sample regimes. My goal for this chapter is to establish these foundations, and to provide some pointers so that you can learn more about this rich topic."
