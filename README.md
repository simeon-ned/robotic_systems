### **What this course is about?**
This course is attempt to explore **modern control paradigms** in terms of **numerical methods** and **optimization**, while relaying on **fundamental theory**, however we will avoid proofs and deep theoretical reasoning, where it possible. (mainly due to time considerations and amount of material)

The material of this course is based on technologies which in my humble opinion are theoretically interesting and practically significant. This in no way means that the reviewed algorithms will be the recipe for resolving all your control problems. However it may give you some view on the modern control field.
