permalink: /
---

### **What this course is about?**
In this course we will explore **simulation** and **modeling techniques** applicable to robotic systems while linking basic knowledge of mechanics to simulation algorithms:

* Recall what a **model** of robotic system is, why it is needed as well as how to build one.
* Consider different approaches to **integration** of dynamics and check the properties of integrators (Implicit/Explicit Euler, Runge-Kutta)
* We will learn how to apply the **Euler-Lagrange equations** to the systems with constraints holonomic and non-holonomic **constraints** (Lagange Multipliers)
* Consider the **numerical algorithms for constrained dynamics** (Udwadia Qalaba)
* Explore and examine the relatively **novel variation integrators**
* Consider the specific features of simulation through **contact**

By the end of the course you will learn how to build **models** of various **robotic systems**: drones, serial and parallel manipulators, mobile robots, etc. You will also exploit different approaches to **simulation** of these systems.
